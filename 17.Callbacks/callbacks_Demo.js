fun(15, gun());//when we put a pair of parenthesis it means we are immediately callling the function and it will throw error as it will return undefined as gun will return undefined as gun is
// not returning anything so console.log returns undefined and in fun (10,undefined) will be passed and  when fn() --> as undefined() called gives error
